# FlowDesk

Introduction - Who I Am
1. my professional background is in videography and photography, after recieving my bachelor degree in media arts and animation, i did freelance photography and videography. I filmed events, commercials, music videos, and did photography for events, e-commerce, fashion, family, headshots, portraits.
2. what inspired flowdesk was having to constantly have clients dm or ask for a price list, or how much this service was, try to talk you down on your prices, remove the unclarity in how much a service cost. When i was reaching out to potential users one person reminded me of myself starting out, because they didnt have a price list and the fee they charged people wasnt consistent. She also didnt have any way to track her services to see how well they were doing. i beleive in order to be successful you must know where your at.

The Pain Point - Why It Matters
1. A particular moment might be when i release engaging content and multiple people flock to my messages inquiring for services and it would look alot more professinal and be more efficient to just have this readily availible in my bio
2. common complaints are being able to not always be on the business side of things, they mainly want to focus on improving the service especially if its somehting they love or maybe started off as a hobby

The Impact & Your Vision-

1. my future goals is to make starting and growing your business easier for self employed people who provide a service. We want your business to flow like the name with no blockages, with the app making things easier for both you and your clients. In the future i want flowdesk to accept payment and even incorporate AI that can read your analytics and give feedback and tips on how to improve business. 
2. I see flowdesk encouraging the average person to try starting a business that they maybe wouldve been to intimidated to do otherwise, creating more job options and enabling people to do what they love and get paid for it.

# Code Review

## Documentation
- Missing setup and installation. Your readme file should help outside developers easily onboard onto your project.
- Missing contribution guidelines
- This reads more like a functional specification or product overview than a traditional README file. See the rubric to review basic components of a readme file

## Version Control
- Good branching and merging overall
- Good commit comments
- No issue tracking and linking to your pull requests

## Code Hygiene
- Lots of commented out code! Get rid of code that you are not using
- Move reusable components such as flashes to partial view templates to improve readability

## Frontend
- In development, the frontend is very buggy. We were unable to review front end in production. Received 502 bad gateway error.

## Deployment
- Url submitted in
