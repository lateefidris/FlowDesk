Foreign Keys: You should almost always index foreign keys as they are used in joins which are common in relational databases. Based on your diagram:
Desks.professional_id (assuming it's a reference to a Users table record)
Bookings.desk_id
Bookings.service_id
Categories.desk_id
Services.category_id
Availabilities.desk_id
Unique Columns: Any columns that are used to identify records uniquely and are frequently queried upon. For example:
Users.email
Users.username
Timestamps: If you query often by creation or update times, you might index these:
created_at and updated_at on any of the tables if you're going to retrieve records by when they were created or last updated.
Searchable Text Fields: If you perform searches on specific text fields, an index can speed this up:
Desks.name
Categories.name
Services.name
Polymorphic Associations: If you have any polymorphic associations in your model, you would index the type and ID fields used in the polymorphism.
Composite Indexes: If you frequently query on a combination of fields, you might create a composite index. For instance, if you often search for availabilities by both desk_id and day_of_the_week, a composite index on those two attributes could be beneficial.
Fields Used in WHERE Clauses: If there are specific fields you use often in WHERE clauses of your queries, those are candidates for indexing.
